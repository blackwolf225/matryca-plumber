# Security policy

Matryca Logseq LLM Wiki is an MCP server that can **read and write Markdown files** under your Logseq graph path and uses **credentials** (for example `LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN` and any LLM provider keys configured in your MCP host). Treating those surfaces carefully is a top priority for the maintainers.

## Please do not file public issues for vulnerabilities

**Do not** open a regular GitHub issue to report a security vulnerability. Public issues disclose the problem before a fix is available and put all users at risk.

## How to report a vulnerability privately

1. **Preferred:** Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/MarcoPorcellato/matryca-logseq-llm-wiki/security/advisories/new) for this repository and submit a **private** security advisory with reproduction steps, impact, and versions affected.  
2. If you cannot use GitHub advisories, contact the repository maintainers through a **private** channel (for example email) and include the same detail you would put in an advisory. Do not paste secrets or real tokens in the report; use redacted examples.

We aim to acknowledge valid reports in a reasonable timeframe and coordinate disclosure after a fix or mitigation is available.

## Scope we care about

Examples include unauthorized file access outside the intended graph, credential leakage via logs or error messages, unsafe defaults that enable destructive writes without user intent, and protocol or transport issues in the MCP bridge that could harm the host machine.

## Non-goals

Misconfiguration on your machine (for example sharing your `.env` or running untrusted MCP hosts) is outside the scope of this policy, though documentation improvements to reduce that risk are welcome as regular contributions.
