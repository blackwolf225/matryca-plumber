# Matryca Plumber

> **v1.5 — Ironclad Release.** Agentic Knowledge Management for Logseq OG. An **enterprise-grade, local-first background AI daemon** with a real-time **Sovereign UI** control room, a **typed CLI**, and **direct Logseq Markdown AST** mutation (no Logseq HTTP API, no auxiliary database). The default experience is **autonomous**: the daemon and Python workers poll your graph, run structured local-LLM passes, and commit indexes and lint artifacts while you work or sleep. An **optional FastMCP stdio sidecar** exposes the same headless mutation plane to external clients (for example Claude Desktop) — same `graph_dispatch` contract, not a separate data path. Heavily inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's LLM-Wiki vision](https://karpathy.ai/blog). **100% native Logseq AST parity**, optimistic concurrency safety, versioned AI authorship stamping.

Matryca Plumber is a **100% headless, sandboxed** **standalone daemon + CLI** that turns your local Logseq graph into a high token-density agentic workspace — **no network APIs and no Logseq desktop JSON-RPC**. It treats your vault as a **tree of blocks**, not a flat document store. Logseq OG remains optional: humans and the daemon co-edit the **same** `.md` trees on disk.

**Matryca Plumber** is not a one-shot script — it is an **enterprise-grade, local-first background AI daemon for Logseq**. It polls your graph on a duty cycle, calls a local LLM (LM Studio or Ollama), appends semantic indexes, runs optional cognitive lint modules, and logs every token transaction — **while you edit the same `.md` files in Logseq or leave the vault idle**. Optional **MCP-attached** sessions reuse the identical mutation plane for interactive queries; they are **not** required for background operation. Every write path mirrors Logseq's on-disk AST contract: page frontmatter at line 0, block properties contiguous to their parent bullet, namespace filenames encoded exactly like Logseq's Clojure Datalog layer, and **optimistic concurrency control** that aborts stale writes when you type during inference.

**Matryca Plumber** turns your local graph into a high token-density agentic workspace by continuously polling your notes, running local LLMs (like LM Studio or Ollama), appending semantic indexes, and healing broken links—all completely offline, while you work or sleep.

**Zero Cloud. Zero Data Leaks. 100% Native Logseq AST.**

## ⚠️ Important: Clone Your Graph First

Matryca Plumber edits your local `.md` files directly. While it features safe Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) to prevent data loss, **we strongly recommend testing it on a clone of your graph first**. This allows you to see the AI in action and explore its capabilities without affecting your primary notes.

**How to safely clone your graph (crucial if you use Logseq Sync):**
1. Make a copy of your entire Logseq graph folder on your computer (e.g., duplicate your `MyGraph` folder and rename it to `MyGraph_Test`).
2. Open Logseq, click on your graph name in the top left, and select **Add new graph**.
3. Choose the new `MyGraph_Test` directory.
4. **If you use Logseq Sync:** Do *not* enable Sync on this test graph. This ensures the AI's test edits remain strictly local and do not propagate to your other devices.
5. Alternatively, for a minimal test graph:
  a. Create an empty folder and add it as a new graph in Logseq.
  b. Close Logseq; copy only pages/, journals/, assets/ from production.
  c. Reopen and Re-index.
6. Point Matryca's `.env` configuration (`LOGSEQ_GRAPH_PATH`) to this test folder.

Once you are comfortable with how Matryca behaves and have tuned the safety tiers, you can point it to your main graph.

## 🚀 Quick Install & Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the blazing-fast Python package manager.

### 1. Try it instantly (Zero-install)
Run the CLI directly without polluting your system:
```bash
uvx --from matryca-plumber matryca-plumber status
```

### 2. Global Installation (Recommended)
Install the binary to use the `matryca` command anywhere:
```bash
uv tool install matryca-plumber
```

### 3. Launch the Daemon & UI
```bash
# 1. Start the daemon in the background
matryca plumber start

# 2. Open the Sovereign UI control room ([http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000))
matryca plumber status
```

### 4. Set it and forget it (Background Service)
Install it as a LaunchAgent/systemd service so it wakes up with your OS:
```bash
matryca service install
```

## 🧠 What does it actually do?

Unlike generic scripts, Matryca is a continuous background engine. When paired with a local LLM (like Gemma or LLaMA via LM Studio or Ollama), it provides:

- **Semantic Indexing**: Automatically generates summaries, suggested tags, and cross-references for your pages.
- **Dangling Link Healing**: Finds broken `[[WikiLinks]]` and creates isolated seed pages for them.
- **Entity Consolidation**: Suggests `alias::` properties for overlapping concepts.
- **Auto-Split Dense Blocks**: Extracts oversized subtrees into new pages to keep your graph fast and readable.
- **Claude Desktop Integration (FastMCP)**: Use Claude to query and mutate your Logseq graph natively.

## 🖥️ The Sovereign UI

Matryca is 100% headless, but it comes with a **Sovereign UI Cockpit** (`matryca plumber status`). 
It's a local React dashboard running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` that provides:
- **Live Graph Telemetry**: See exactly what the AI is indexing in real-time.
- **Dynamic Impact**: Mathematically separates *Organic Human Mind* (your notes) from *Agent Cognition* (AI enhancements).
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Every REST call requires a Bearer token. No anonymous access, even on localhost.
- **Trust & Safety Drawer**: Visually toggle what the AI is allowed to edit (Safe Mode, Augmented Mode, Surgeon Mode).

## ✨ Key Features & Differentiators

* 🤖 **100% Local-First & Headless:** No Logseq HTTP API required. It edits the `.md` files directly using atomic file I/O.
* 📐 **Exact Logseq AST Compliance:** True line-0 page frontmatter, block properties at +2 indent, and exact namespace encoding. Other tools break your graph; Matryca keeps it pristine.
* 🔐 **Optimistic Concurrency Control:** It checks `st_mtime` before any AI inference. If you typed in Logseq while the AI was "thinking", Matryca aborts its write. **No silent data loss.**
* 🪟 **Windows, macOS & Linux Support:** Runs safely in the background everywhere using a robust cross-platform lock (`.matryca_plumber_daemon.lock`).
* ⚡ **Context Acceleration Shield:** Obliterates LLM prefill latency on 5,000+ block pages by using hierarchical summaries instead of raw megabyte-class text.

## 🛡️ Trust & Safety Risk Tiers

You are in control. Nothing mutates your prose unless you explicitly enable it in the UI.

| Mode | Risk | What it allows |
|------|------|----------------|
| 🟢 **Safe Mode** | Read-only | Semantic routing cache, entity consolidation (`alias::`), property hygiene — **never edits your bullet text**. |
| 🟠 **Augmented Mode** | Side-blocks | **Heal Dangling Links**, **Backpropagate Links** (appends foldable context sections) — your original bullets stay intact. |
| 🔴 **Surgeon Mode** | Inline edits | **Inline Semantic Corrections** (wraps concepts in `[[WikiLinks]]`), **Auto-Split Dense Blocks** — **strictly opt-in**. |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Quickstart

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The only **required** variable is your graph path:

```env
LOGSEQ_GRAPH_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/Logseq/graph
MATRYCA_LM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1   # LM Studio or Ollama endpoint
MATRYCA_LM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder-7b              # Exact model name loaded
```

*(See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for advanced thermal pacing, context compression, and deep linter settings).*
