# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve **matryca-logseq-llm-wiki**. This project bridges AI agents with **Logseq OG** using pure local Markdown and a block-oriented outliner model.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. **Open an issue** (or comment on an existing one) for larger features so design and scope stay aligned.
3. **Keep pull requests focused**: one logical change per PR is easier to review and bisect.

## Local setup

1. Use **Python 3.12+** (see ``.python-version``).
2. Install **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**. That is the only required toolchain besides a CPython interpreter compatible with the project.
3. From the repository root, install dependencies and dev tools:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   This runs ``uv sync --extra dev`` and lets **uv** manage the virtual environment (typically ``.venv/``).

4. Optional: activate the environment for a classic shell, or keep using **uv** via ``uv run`` and **Make** targets:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Run ``make help`` for a short description of every target (format, lint, typecheck, test, check, clean).

5. Copy the environment template and fill in values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Set `LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN`, `LOGSEQ_API_URL`, and `LOGSEQ_GRAPH_PATH` for your machine.

6. **Before you open a Pull Request**, run the full quality gate so formatting, linting, strict typing, and tests all pass:

   ```bash
   make check
   ```

   This applies Ruff fixes and formatting, runs Ruff lint, **mypy** on ``src/`` and ``tests/``, and **pytest**. Aligning with this step keeps reviews fast and matches what maintainers expect from a green contribution.

## The “atomic block” paradigm

Logseq OG treats **indented bullets** as a tree of blocks. When agents (or humans) edit files:

- Prefer **nested bullets** over flattening ideas into prose paragraphs.
- Preserve **`id:: <uuid>`** lines when moving or refactoring blocks so graph references stay stable.
- Assume **human–AI co-editing** on the same `.md` files; avoid changes that only make sense inside a proprietary database.

Code and tooling in this repo should reinforce block-grained read/write paths and clear validation at boundaries (e.g. Pydantic models for tool inputs).

## Pull request checklist

- Explain **why** the change is needed and any trade-offs.
- Keep types and docstrings accurate for public APIs.
- Do not commit secrets (no `.env`, tokens, or private graph paths).

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Report problems privately if needed; we aim for a welcoming environment for contributors of all backgrounds.
