## Problem Description

`scan_existing_tana_ids` in `src/agent/importers/tana/write.py` calls `read_graph_file_text` for every scannable page/journal, materializing full page bodies in RAM to regex-scan `tana-id::` values.

On a 10k-page vault (~50 KB average), peak memory can reach hundreds of MB before the scan completes; only the ID set is retained.

Complements [#154](https://github.com/MarcoPorcellato/matryca-plumber/issues/154) (graph-build RAM) — this slice is the **pre-write idempotency gate**.

## Proposed Architectural Solution

Stream line-by-line per file (`path.open` + `_TANA_ID_PATTERN.search(line)`); peak RAM O(longest line), not O(vault size). Preserve `errors="replace"` and skip `OSError` on races.

Add test with multi-page fixture asserting IDs found without full-text mock.

## Estimated Impact

Alto on large vaults before Tana import apply — complements `ijson` parse anti-OOM.
